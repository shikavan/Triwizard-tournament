##  The 3 Challenges

###  1. Get the Dragon’s Egg
In this game, the player must steal a golden egg from a dragon.
The dragon throws fireballs, and the player has only 3 lives — each hit takes one life.
There are 5 locked gates that can only be opened by collecting keys scattered across the area.

To win:
 -Avoid fireballs
 -Collect all 5 keys
 -Reach the golden egg safely

###  2. Snitch Escape
In this game, the player moves around a maze to collect all the golden pellets scattered across the map.
But there’s a catch — two Death Eaters are roaming the maze, trying to catch you!

To win:
 -Collect all the pellets
 -Avoid getting caught by the ghosts
 -If a ghost touches you, it's game over.

###  3. The Enchanted Maze
In this final game, you’re dropped into a magical maze where the walls keep moving!
Even the exit keeps changing, so you have to stay alert.
Your goal is to find your way to the exit before time runs out.
